# VBA-challenge

In the attached word document, you will see the VBA code I wrote to loop through the 700k+ rows of stock data to calculate the yearly change, percent change and total stock volume, as well as list the results. I also had it loop through multiple sheets, each representing a different year. In the same word document, you will see screenshots of the results.
